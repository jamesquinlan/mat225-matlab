# Introduction to Programming with MATLAB


## Course description
This course focuses on the fundamental concepts of computer programming and the development of computer programs using MATLAB programming environment. The objectives are to learn essential computer programming concepts and to apply these concepts in computer-based problem-solving. The course includes flow-charting fundamentals, decision structures, sequential execution, repetition, subroutines, functions, user interface design, and data structures. There will be some emphasis on developing computer programs that handle numerical data. The course incorporates mathematical topics such as matrix algebra, polynomial interpolation, linear and non-linear algebraic systems, correlation and regression, time series, gradient vectors, and contour plots to illustrate programming concepts. This course progresses from developing simple concept-driven programs to more complicated programs that read, manipulate, display, and store data. MAT 225 is appropriate for mathematics and science majors and minors; MAT 525 includes advanced programming work for graduate students. 3.000 Credit hours


## Learning Outcomes
After this course students will be able to: 
* Create variables to store data
* Apply relational and logical operators
* Create and operate on matrices, cell arrays, structures, and class objects
* Apply programming constructs such as decision structures and repetition structures to solve scientific problems
* Plot (to visualize) data and identify relationships among variables. Write reusable code using functions
* Import, export, and display data from external files
* Acquire, analyze, manipulate, and evaluate numerical information
* Identify MATLAB programming best practices, including programming guidelines, conventions, code optimization, and knowledge of common pitfalls
*  Debug code of logical, syntax, and runtime errors
